            A perspective to represent polynomials.

        \[1 + 3x + 3y + 2x^2 + 2xy = (1 + x + y)(1 + 2x) \]

            {1 + 3x + 3y + 2x^2 + 2xy} = {1 + x + y}.{1 + 2x}

            Muliplication is convolution.
            Division is merely a game of finding pattern.

            <li><p>Solve corners first.</p></li>
            <li><p>Compare to long division, you don't have to follow sequence if you know that the quotient is divisible by the denominator, just make sure that every bin has been counted (like convolution).</p></li>
            <li><p>If you follow the sequence, from highest degree, you will get lowest degree remainder.</p></li>
        </ul>

            Using human visual cortex to solve polynomial algebra,
            we can exploit the consistency in the structure.
            The benefit lies in the fact that 
            we do not have to rearrange the degree terms to sum the coefficients.
            We can immediately find terms at a glance.
            Though using this method in Euclidean space, we can extend to 3 variables. But I believe that more if possible for someone that can reason with high dimension.

            I'm a cognitive scientist.
            I essentially turn polynomial algebra into a simple graphic game.
            I hope this idea will help those who struggle in math.
